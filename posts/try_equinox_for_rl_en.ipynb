    "I recently tried [equinox](https://docs.kidger.site/equinox/), a [jax](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)-based library for defining and managing neural nets, and I liked it. So in this blog post I will introduce equinox and demonstrate its use with a reinforcement learning example. Other jax-based NN libraries include [haiku](https://dm-haiku.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) from Deepmind and [flax](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) from Google Research. Both are actually quite similar because their designs are based on [stax](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax.example_libraries.stax.html), which is a reference implementation by the Jax developers. In other words, I would say that both haiku and flax are libraries that have added a PyTorch-like `Module` to stax. An [equinox document](https://docs.kidger.site/equinox/examples/init_apply/) briefly summarizes the approach of haiku and flax, calling it the 'init-apply approach'. Let's start this blog post by paraphrasing that document.\n",

    "# What jax can do for you, and what it doesn't provide\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what can jax do? Its webpage says that:\n",
    "\n",
    "> JAX is Autograd and XLA, brought together for high-performance numerical computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "[XLA](https://www.tensorflow.org/xla) is an intermediate language for deep learning developed as a backend to Tensorflow. It's intended for producing optimized programs for vector accelartors like GPU, TPU, and even modern CPU's SIMD instructions. Jax provides a NumPy-like library called `jax.numpy` as a front-end to XLA, which allows NumPy-like Python code to be vector-parallelized into fast GPU code by runtime (just-in-time) compilation. So what is Autograd? This is also the name of a library previously developed by the developers of jax, but you can think of it as autodifferentiation in general. Autodifferentiation is a technique to automatically derive gradients of functions in numerical computation. Jax supports autograd, which means that you can derive the partial derivative of the function w.r.t. your inputs, without explicitly write the code to do that. Let's try to compute the partial derivative of $f(x, y) = x^2 + y$:"

    "Since $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}f = 2x, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}f = 1$, the outputs look correct.\n",
    "Since jax automatically computes partial derivatives, you can use it directly for gradient descent to train your NN model. In addition, if you put the computation of taking this gradient and updating the model into `jax.jit`, it can acceralate the whole model traning procedure.\n",
    "The problem here is that there are too many parameters in the case of deep neural networks, so it would be too much work to write a program like this, assigning variables for every single parameter. This is a surprisingly serious problem because recent deep NN often have too many parameters, difficult to manage by hand. So I want a system to efficiently manage the all parameters of my model with covenient abstractions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## NN parameter management by init-apply approach\n",
    "\n",
    "In stax, haiku, and flax, this problem of parameter management is solved by the so-called \"init-apply approach\", which can be summarized as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. the *model* has no parameters\n",
    "2. instead, the *model* is just a set of two functions: `init` and `apply`\n",
    "  - `init` takes an example input, initializes the parameters, and returns the initial parameter\n",
    "  - `apply` takes input and parameters, and then compute the output of the model\n",
    "  \n",
    "So the APIs for flax and haiku are as follows. While there are a number of differences (e.g., flax uses `__call__` (while haiku uses `forward` like PyTorch (just like how Chainer and PyTorch differ), `flax` employs [`dataclasses.dataclass`](https:// docs.python.org/en/3/library/dataclasses.html#dataclasses.dataclass) for Module class), their design is quite similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Linear(Module):\n",
    "    def __call__(self, x):\n",
    "        batch_size = x.shape[0]\n",
    "        w = self.parameter(output, shape=(batch_size, self.output_size) init=self.w_init)\n",
    "        b = self.parameter(output, shape=(1, self.output_size) init=self.w_init)\n",
    "        return w @ x.T + b\n",
    "\n",
    "model = Linear(output_size=10)\n",
    "params = model.init(jnp.zeros(1, 100))\n",
    "result = model.apply(params, jnp.zeros(10, 100))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, I used `Module` to represent the abstract class for defining NN. Note that he method `self.parameter` in the above example is the counterpart of the parameter registration functions in `flax` and `haiku`. In the case of `haiku`, the `params` is the following `dict`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "{\n",
    "    \"Linear/~/w\": [...],\n",
    "    \"Linear/~/b\": [...],\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So, it means that users need to know this naming scheme to access a specific value of parameter.\n",
    "`stax` doesn't have `Module` feature. Instead, it provides function combinator to combine multiple `init` and `apply`. Then let's summarize the pros and cons of this approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros**\n",
    "\n",
    "- No need to specify the shape of the input Array when initializing the Module\n",
    "  - Parameters are initialized when `init` is called\n",
    "- Functions and data are separated\n",
    "  - Module has no variables that can be changed, and is treated completely separately from its parameters\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Disadvantages**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- (Only haiku/flax) Module is redundant\n",
    "  - Module only has \"model settings\" such as output dimensions\n",
    "- Direct access to parameter elements is cumbersome\n",
    "  - For example, in haiku, each parameter element can be accessed with `params[\"Linear/~/w\"]`, so we need to understand this naming scheme for keys to check parameters\n",
    "- Not very object oriented\n",
    "  - Because classes don't have data\n",
    "- (Only haiku/flax) Parameter calls in Module need to be converted to functions that can be used by `jax.grad`.\n",
    "  - For example, `haiku.transform` converts functions that include parameter calls with `haiku.get_parameter` into functions that take parameters as arguments\n",
    "\n",

    "It returned the gradient correctly. The constant `sqrt_d_attn` is exactly masked by `None`. So, if you want to have a constant in a Module, just use a type other than `jax.Array` or `ndarray` for now. If you want to have a constant as `jax.Array`, you can't `filter_value_and_grad` directly and you need to manually decompose the struct. So I recommend to just have constants as Python built-in types such as `float`. If you use `jax.jit`, they are just compiled to a part of binary code, so it adds no overhead.\n",

    "### Rollout\n",
    "\n",
    "In PPO implementations, it is common to collect a history of environmental interaction about 500~8000 steps and use it to update the network several times. Here we use [jax.lax.scan](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jaxpr.html#scan) to implement a rollout that is faster than native Python for loop. While scan is super fast, its usage requires a bit of care. In particular, if you set the second output of the function that moves forward one step to `results: list[Result]`, keep in mind that the final return will be `Result(member1=stack([m1 for m1 in results.member1]), ...)`\n",
    "Also, since the argument of `exec_rollout` contains a `SoftmaxPPONet` which is an instance of `eqx.Module`, you can't use `jax.jit` directly. Instead, you need to use `eqx.filter_jit` that decomposes the module to parameters and non-parameters automatically.\n",
    "Actions are sampled by a categorical distribution obtained by applying softmax to the output of the policy network, but since `Observation` contains an `action_mask` that tells you the direction in which you can move in the maze, you can mask the actions you cannot take with this by applying `-inf` to policy logits. In a simple environment, you don't need to do this, but mazes with many walls are difficult to solve without this masking."

Through writing this post, I found `eqx.filter_jit` very useful. Since I already get used to it, I feel a bit more frastration to write `@partial(jax.jit, static_argnums=(2, 3))` every time.\n",
